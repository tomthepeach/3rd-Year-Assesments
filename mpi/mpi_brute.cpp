// I'm aware that some of you are uncertain about how the MPI implementation should work for the assessed exercise, 
// in particular why reduction is a good approach for this problem, and the impact on load balancing.
// We went through this in the office hours, but I know that not all of you were able to attend,
// so in the interest of fairness I've put together a few slides explaining in a bit more detail how this works for the
// brute force approach.  A very similar approach can be used for the cell list 
// (i.e. the same reduction approach can be used, but the loop structure and load balancing will be different).
// There is no video to accompany it, but hopefully the slides are complete enough as a standalone - 
// I have added these to week 14 on blackboard.  I hope you find this useful!

// In addition, the smallest problem size should run very quickly, so if you are uncertain about whether or not you
// are getting the correct answers and feel more comfortable writing in python, I recommend you implement the simple
// brute force approach in python as a sanity check.  This should not take many lines of code.

// Finally, to clarify the mark scheme - this has been designed so that increasing levels of complexity are needed to
// achieve a higher grade, so in the first instance you should start with the simplest approach, prioritising correctness,
// and only implement a more complicated approach once you are sure this is correct.  The hardest part of this assessment
// is the cell list approach, however this is only necessary if you are aiming to achieve a 1st. In order to get a 2:1
// you need to implement either a cell list approachÂ or a brute force approach with optimal MPI load balancing.  
// In other words, you can still achieve a good 2:1 without even attempting the cell list approach.
